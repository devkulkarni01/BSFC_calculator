BSFC Calculator for CONVERGE CFD
This repository contains a Python application for calculating Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) based on engine output data. The application uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter to allow users to input engine parameters, process data from files, and visualize results through interactive plots.

Features
File Import: Load engine output data from a file.
User Input: Enter engine RPM and fuel mass.
Data Processing: Calculate the area under the PV diagram, power output, and BSFC.
Visualization: Display interactive plots of engine data.
Navigation: Switch between different plots using navigation buttons.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter
Matplotlib
NumPy
SciPy


The application will process the file and display the results, including:

Area under the PV diagram - Work DOne
Power output
Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC)
